# My Personal .dotfiles

Welcome to my `.dotfiles`! 

This repo is just for sync purposes - making sure my configs are uniform across PCs to ensure expectable, reproducable results no matter where I am.

However, I've also decided to make this repo public, in case someone stumbles across it while looking for their *own* `.dotfile` inspiration. If this is you, welcome! My stuff's fairly basic, because, well, my needs are basic. 

HUGE thanks to Dreams of Autonomy for his videos on his personal configuration. His videos were a great source of inspiration for my own configs.
