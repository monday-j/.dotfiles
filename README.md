# My Personal .dotfiles

Welcome to my `.dotfiles`! 

This repo is just for sync purposes - making sure my configs are uniform across PCs to ensure expectable, reproducable results no matter where I am.

However, I've also decided to make this repo public, in case someone stumbles across it while looking for their *own* `.dotfile` inspiration. If this is you, welcome! My stuff's fairly basic, because, well, my needs are basic. 

HUGE thanks to [Dreams of Autonomy](https://github.com/dreamsofautonomy) for his [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@dreamsofautonomy) on his personal configuration. These were a great source of inspiration for my own configs. You *might* notice that my configuration, at least in its current state, is very similar to his - this is by design! Over time, as I learn more about my specific use case and way I like to navigate my terminal, I'll branch off from his and make mine more unique. For now however, I'm 100% on the dreams-of-monday-j train.
